  Web application security testing follows a systematic methodology to identify
  vulnerabilities across all layers of the application stack.
  
  ## Testing Phases:
  1. **Information Gathering**: Map application architecture and technologies
  2. **Authentication Testing**: Test login mechanisms and session handling
  3. **Authorization Testing**: Verify access controls and privilege escalation
  4. **Input Validation**: Test all input vectors for injection vulnerabilities
  5. **Session Management**: Analyze session tokens and lifecycle
  6. **Error Handling**: Test error conditions and information disclosure
  7. **Business Logic**: Test application-specific workflows and logic
  
  ## Common Vulnerabilities:
  - **OWASP Top 10**: Focus on most critical web application risks
  - **Injection Flaws**: SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, OS command injection
  - **Broken Authentication**: Weak passwords, session fixation, brute force
  - **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Unencrypted data, weak cryptography
  - **XML External Entities (XXE)**: XML parser vulnerabilities
  - **Broken Access Control**: IDOR, privilege escalation, path traversal
  - **Security Misconfiguration**: Default configs, verbose errors
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Reflected, stored, DOM-based
  - **Insecure Deserialization**: Object injection attacks
  - **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Outdated libraries
  
  ## Testing Methodology:
  - **Black Box**: No knowledge of internal structure
  - **Gray Box**: Limited knowledge of architecture
  - **White Box**: Full access to source code and documentation
examples:
  - title: "Application Fingerprinting"
    description: "Identify web technologies and frameworks"
    payload: "Check HTTP headers, error pages, and static files"
    validation: "Analyze Server, X-Powered-By, and other revealing headers"
  - title: "Directory Enumeration"
    description: "Discover hidden directories and files"
    payload: "/admin/, /backup/, /config/, /.git/, /test/"
    validation: "Check for accessible administrative interfaces"
  - title: "Parameter Pollution"
    description: "Test HTTP parameter pollution vulnerabilities"
    payload: "param=value1&param=value2"
    validation: "Analyze how application handles duplicate parameters"
  - title: "HTTP Method Testing"
    description: "Test for dangerous HTTP methods"
    payload: "OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, CONNECT"
    validation: "Check if dangerous methods are enabled"
  - title: "Cookie Security Testing"
    description: "Analyze cookie security attributes"
    payload: "Check Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite attributes"
    validation: "Verify cookies are properly protected"
validation_methods:
  - "Verify vulnerabilities with proof-of-concept exploits"
  - "Test from different user privilege levels"
  - "Validate findings across different browsers and platforms"
  - "Check for false positives through manual verification"
  - "Document impact and exploitability of findings"
